    <name>OSGiVersion Maven Plugin</name>
    <description>Maven Plugin for computing OSGi versions from Maven versions</description>

    <!--
         This plugin is used during build of all OSGi artifacts in HK2 like core,
         config, auto-depends, etc. If we make this part of hk2-maven-plugin,
         it will cause a circular dependency like this:
         hk2-maven-plugin -> hk2-maven -> core -> hk2-maven-plugin.
         So, this is separated from hk2-maven-plugin.
         This plugin is used to set a predefined property called
         project.osgi.version which can then be used in pom.xmls.
